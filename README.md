# FactStationDAO

## About
FactStationDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) designed to combat fake news and false information in the era of decentralized social media. Our mission is to encourage the flow of correct information by providing a robust fact-checking and content verification service.

## Project Description
FactStationDAO offers content verification services for social media DAOs and proposal verification for other DAOs. We collect information from DAO platforms and leverage our community of experts for verification.

### Key Features:
- Content fetching from decentralized social media apps
- Fact-checking by a selected group of DAO community members
- Voting system to determine content validity
- Option for members to revoke voting rights for content outside their expertise
- Classification of content as "Verified and True," "Not Verified," or "Verified and Questionable"

## How it Works
1. Social media apps push their content to IPFS storage
2. Each post receives a unique ID
3. DAO members are selected to vote on content validity
4. Votes are weighted and results are generated
5. Content is classified based on voting results

## Technology Stack
- IPFS for content storage
- ERC-20 tokens for DAO membership
- Smart contracts for voting and result tabulation

## Tokenomics
FactStationDAO uses ERC-20 tokens for membership. Token holders can participate in the fact-checking process and governance of the DAO.
